# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project! This is a side project, so contributions are welcome but not expected.

## Getting Started

See the [README](README.md) for installation and usage instructions.

## Branch Protection

Direct commits to `main`/`master` are disabled. All changes must go through a pull request from a feature branch. Required status checks (CI tests) must pass before merging. To enable this:

1. Go to **Settings → Branches** in your GitHub repo
2. Add a branch protection rule for `main` (or `master`)
3. Enable **Require a pull request before merging**
4. Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging** and add the `test` job
5. Optionally enable **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
